# Photo_to_3D
This project is a Python-based tool that generates a 3D point cloud model from an image. It primarily uses MiDaS, a depth estimation model, to convert a single RGB image into a relative depth map. The depth map is then back-projected into 3D space to form a colored point cloud, which is saved as a .ply file.
